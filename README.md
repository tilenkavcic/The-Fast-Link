# The Fast Link

## What is it?

Quickly make beautiful links that make subscribing to your podcast a breeze. We want to make it easier and more effective for you to promote your podcast on social media and elsewhere.

Here's a video of how creating a new podcast works and how you  can add custom links to any podcast platform.
